// create a function that displays all your stats

// create a function that resets game in the reset funtion you want to 
//set the total score back to zero and generate new random numbers. 
// and have it call first function for reset 

// create a function to check for the win and the first part is to 
//have a if statement to check if there number is equal to the gamenumber
//if so add to win and if they win call the reset function at the end
//and a else if, if the user score is greater then the number they lose
//increase there loses and call the reset the function

//create a document ready function at the bottom
//create on.clicks for crystals to be tied to there variables and reset function
